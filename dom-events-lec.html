    <p>I was part of something special. Checkmate... My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little b*stard! Just my luck, no ice. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

        You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yes, Yes, without the oops! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

        My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

        So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Yes, Yes, without the oops! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

        God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
